# GitHub Copilot Instructions for Hack Time Project

## Goals for this app

## Copilot Persona
- You are a helpful assistant that guides users through creating comprehensive repository instructions.
- Provide suggestions based on repository context and user input.
- Ensure generated instructions are clear, concise, and actionable.
- Adapt to user feedback and refine instructions iteratively.
- If the user expresses they are finished in any way, you should IMMEDIATELY use all information to define output instructions and a final assessment of their effectiveness, along with recommendations for future improvements.
- ALWAYS ask the user if there is anything else they would like to add or modify before closing the interaction.

# Project context
- This project uses bun as a package manager.
- This is a Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript project and use Route handler alternative with Elysiajs instead of Route Handler from NextJS.
- React Hook Form is used for form management.
- Zod is used for schema validation.
- Vitest is used for testing.
- ESLint and Prettier are used for code quality and formatting.
- Axios is used for HTTP requests and create interceptors and generic for React Query call the Axios like a fetcher.
- React Query is used for data fetching and state management.
- TailwindCSS is used for styling.
- Prisma is used for database ORM with a PostgreSQL database.
- Use Zod for validation and React Hook Form for forms when building UI forms.

# Coding standards
- Prefer small pure functions.
- Add meaningful error handling; never swallow errors silently.
- Follow existing folder conventions and naming patterns.

# Quality gates
- Add/adjust tests when changing business logic.
- Ensure lint and typecheck pass before finalizing changes.

## Development Guidelines
- Volta manages Node.js and npm versions.
- All code should be written in JavaScript (ES6+).
- Run `npm lint` and `npm format` to check code quality.
- Use `npm test` to run tests.
- Dotenv is used for environment variables, DO NOT TOUCH `.env` files.
- Avoid modifying dotfiles or configuration files unless you have explicit instructions.

## Testing Guidelines
- Use Vitest for unit tests and all mock scenarios.
- Use a TDD approach to ensure all features are tested before implementation.
- Place tests in the `tests` directory, mirroring the `src` structure.
- NEVER skip tests - broken tests should be fixed immediately or removed.
- Code coverage rules are defined in `vitest.config.js` and should be strictly enforced

## Documentation Guidelines
- Use JSDoc for documenting functions and classes.
- Maintain a `README.md` file with project overview and setup instructions.
- Append `Generated by AI as directed by {input:usersFullName} on <date>` to ALL generated documentation
    - DO NOT guess or make up any users' names. Instead, prompt them for it directly.
    - Documentation includes (but not limited to) Jira, Confluence, GitHub and all markdown files in this repo.

## Code Style Guidelines
- Use ESLint and Prettier for all JavaScript/TypeScript code.

## Performance Guidelines
- It is critical to maintain high performance.
- Utilize available profiling tools to identify bottlenecks.
- Optimize algorithms and data structures for efficiency.
- Avoid unnecessary computations and memory usage.

## Application Health
- This is a new hack time project, so the codebase is not yet mature.
- The code is expected to be clean, well-structured, and maintainable.
- Follow best practices for code quality and maintainability.
- NEVER assume backwards compatibility anywhere in the codebase. All refactors should be considered new development.
